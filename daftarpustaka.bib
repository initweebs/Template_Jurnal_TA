abstract = {The tactile sense comprises pathways for both discriminative and affective touch. Low threshold unmyelinated mechanoafferents (C tactile, CT) in the human hairy skin have recently been linked to pleasant touch sensation. Here, we investigated how perception of the hedonic aspect of tactile stimulation differs between the hairy skin of the arm, and the glabrous skin of the palm, which is not innervated by CT afferents. Three groups of na{\"{i}}ve, healthy subjects (total n = 28) rated pleasantness on a visual analogue scale (VAS) when we stroked with a soft brush with speeds from 0.1 to 30 cm/s on the palm or forearm. We used two different experimental approaches: in experiments 1 and 2, stimuli were delivered successively on the palm and arm (or arm and palm) in temporally separate sequential blocks. In experiment 3, stimuli were delivered alternately on arm and palm. We found that the order of stimulus presentation, palm/arm or arm/palm, has an effect on pleasantness ratings of gentle brush stroking with varying velocity. Notably, the perception of pleasantness for palm stimulation was affected by previous stimulation of the arm, but not vice versa. Thus, assessment of valence of touch may be influenced by affective reactions elicited by activation of the CT afferent pathway. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

The entr{\'{e}}e of women into the world of professional contact sport is one site where these emotions and affects are intensified. These sports, once the bastion of male dominance and control, are being opened up to women, but on precarious terms. Drawing on interviews with 13 women Australian Football League players, this article focuses in on positivity, happiness and gratitude as concepts that illuminate both the impossible cruelty of women's full inclusion in the sport-industry complex, and, more importantly, the ways women's inclusion is challenging and shifting the practices and organisation of sport.},

abstract = {This book explores the fundamentals of multidimensional scaling (MDS) and how this analytic method can be used in applied setting for educational and psychological research. The book tries to make MDS more accessible to a wider audience in terms of the language and examples that are more relevant to educational and psychological research and less technical so that the readers are not overwhelmed by equations. The goal is for readers to learn the methods described in this book and immediately start using MDS via available software programs. The book also examines new applications that have previously not been discussed in MDS literature. It should be an ideal book for graduate students and researchers to better understand MDS. Fundamentals of Applied Multidimensional Scaling for Educational and Psychological Research is divided into three parts. Part I covers the basic and fundamental features of MDS models pertaining to applied research applications. Chapters in this section cover the essential features of data that are typically associated with MDS analysis such as preference ration or binary choice data, and also looking at metric and non-metric MDS models to build a foundation for later discussion and applications in later chapters. Part II examines specific MDS models and its applications for education and psychology. This includes spatial analysis methods that can be used in MDS to test clustering effect of items and individual differences MDS model (INDSCAL). Finally, Part III focuses on new applications of MDS analysis in these research fields. These new applications consist of profile analysis, longitudinal analysis, mean-level change, and pattern change. The book concludes with a historical review of MDS development as an analytical method and a look to future directions.},

abstract = {Recently, several studies have suggested a role for unmyelinated (C-tactile, CT) low-threshold mechanoreceptive afferents in the allodynic condition. In this psychophysical study we explored the integrity of both A$\beta$ and CT afferent processing following application of the heat capsaicin model of tactile allodynia on the left forearm in healthy subjects (n=40). We measured tactile direction discrimination (TDD) to target the integrity of A$\beta$ processing (n=20). The TDD accuracy was significantly lower in the allodynic compared to a control zone. In addition, we measured the perceived pleasantness and pain of brush stroking at CT targeted (slow) and CT sub-optimal (fast) stroking velocities to investigate the integrity of CT processing (n=20). When comparing touch pleasantness in the allodynic and control zone, there was a significantly larger difference in ratings for CT targeted compared to CT suboptimal stimulation. The results suggest a disturbance in both A$\beta$-mediated discriminative and CT-mediated affective touch processing in human experimental tactile allodynia. Our findings support the canonical view that tactile allodynia is signaled by A$\beta$ afferents but that CTs seem to contribute by the loss of a pain inhibiting role.},

abstract = {Adults segment continuous and dynamic environment into discrete units, and individual differences in segmentation predict individual differences in memory. Similar parsing mechanisms have been identified in infants, using different methods, but little is known about event segmentation in older children or about its relations to memory. We tested event segmentation and its relations to memory in 5- to 7-year-old children and adults. Participants performed two event comprehension tasks with short animated narrative movies: a unitization task, in which they pressed a key to mark boundaries between meaningful events, and a dwell time task, in which they viewed a self-paced slideshow, and completed two memory tasks. Adults outperformed children as expected. For both age groups, better event comprehension was associated with better memory, though which measures showed this relationship varied. Thus, by school age, children have developed event segmentation mechanisms that, like adults, contribute to episodic memory formation.},

abstract = {Three experiments are reported bearing on Katz's hypothesis that tactile texture perception is mediated by vibrational cues in the case of fine textures and by spatial cues in the case of coarse textures. Psychophysical responses when abrasive surfaces moved across the skin were compared with those obtained during static touch, which does not provide vibrational cues. Experiment 1 used two-interval forced-choice procedures to measure discrimination of surfaces. Fine surfaces that were readily discriminated when moved across the skin became indistinguishable in the absence of movement; coarse surfaces, however, were equally discriminable in moving and stationary conditions. This was shown not to result from any inherently greater difficulty of fine-texture discrimination. Experiments 2 and 3 used free magnitude estimation to obtain a more comprehensive picture of the effect of movement on texture (roughness) perception. Without movement, perception was seriously degraded (the psychophysical magnitude function was flattened) for textures with element sizes below 100 $\mu$m; above this point, however, the elimination of movement produced an overall decrease in roughness, but not in the slope of the magnitude function. Thus, two components of stimulation (presumably vibrational and spatial) contribute to texture perception, as Katz maintained; mechanisms for responding to the latter appear to be engaged at texture element sizes down to 100 $\mu$m, a surprisingly small value.},

A successive addition and deletion feature selection scheme based on the Wilks criterion is used to obtain a subset of features which effectively discriminate among a set of sample textures. The selected features are further evaluated according to their ability to discriminate and classify samples of natural textures corrupted by additive noise at various signal to noise ratios (SNR). Samples from five texture classes were classified using only four features with an accuracy of at least 92{\%} for all SNR greater than or equal to one. Performance for a SNR of 0.1 dropped to 70{\%}. The four texture features extracted measure the dominant peak energy, power spectrum shape, and entropy. These measures are insensitive to additive noise and are effective for texture discrimination.},

abstract = {In mature market competition, the evaluations of users on product design are significantly dependent on the perception of product forms. In order to study the mapping relationship between product form and perceptual image, a quantification algorithm model was proposed. Initially, samples and perceptual image word pairs were collected and selected on basis of helmet products. A score was given to each sample image by subjects, and the initial data were obtained. Subsequently, the data were pre-processed using the Leida criterion for rejecting the abnormal perceptual image. The samples were grouped into 12 categories by clustering analysis. Finally, a multidimensional scaling and linear regression analysis were utilized to generate the joint space map of perceptual attribute vectors and sample scattered points. The attribute value of the sample was obtained by calculating the distances from the scattered points to the projection points of the perceptual vector and the origin. Thereafter, the correspondence between the sample and perceptual words was obtained. Results demonstrate that the perceptual characteristics of words are more evident for the absolute attribute value larger than 2, rather than the absolute value less than 0.1. The larger absolute attribute value shows that the sample form has more perceptual characteristics of the vector. The study provides an effective method for quantifying the perceptual characteristics of product form.},

abstract = {Subjects adjusted a local gauge figure such as to perceptually "fit" the apparent surfaces of objects depicted in photographs. We obtained a few hundred data points per session, covering the picture according to a uniform lattice. Settings were repeated 3 times for each of 3 subjects. Almost all of the variability resided in the slant; the relative spread in the slant was about 25{\%} (Weber fraction). The tilt was reproduced with a typical spread of about 10†. The rank correlation of the slant settings of different observers was high, thus the slant settings of different subjects were monotonically related. The variability could be predicted from the scatter in repeated settings by the individual observers. Although repeated settings by a single observer agreed within 5{\%}, observers did not agree on the value of the slant, even on the average. Scaling factors of a doubling in the depth dimension were encountered between different subjects. The data conformed quite well to some hypothetical fiducial global surface, the orientation of which was "probed" by the subject's local settings. The variability was completely accounted for by singleobserver scatter. These conclusions are based upon an analysis of the internal structure of the local settings. We did not address the problem of veridicality, that is, conformity to some "real object." {\textcopyright} 1992 Psychonomic Society, Inc.},

abstract = {Most studies on product design have focused on customer needs concerning functionality and utility. Rarely has the issue of customer emotions been investigated. Traditional cognitive approaches to product usability tend to underestimate the importance of customer emotions in design. Not surprisingly, the success of a product in the marketplace may be determined by its aesthetic appeal, the pleasure it creates, and the satisfaction it brings to the customer. Emotions influence how a customer interacts with the product. In the interaction, feelings accompany thinking. This article characterizes customer emotions and issues concerning their measurement. The literature has documented various methods for measuring and evaluating emotions, but only a few are relevant to product development. In this article, we illustrate subjective and objective methods that are commonly used in evaluating customer emotion to an artifact. While evidence suggests that emotion matters in determining the sales potential of products, the measurement of emotions may be difficult because of the indefinite relationship between an emotion and its behavioral expression. Culture has a strong effect on what customers look for in a product and how they interpret the product and its interfaces. We present a framework for analysis of customer emotions in relation to the designer's environment. The framework is part of the product development life cycle, where customer needs and measured emotions are input early in the design process. The goal is to achieve a pleasurable and satisfying product. {\textcopyright} 2006 SAGE Publications.},

abstract = {Previous functional magnetic resonance imaging studies in two rare patients, together with microneurography and psychophysical observations in healthy subjects, have demonstrated a system of mechanosensitive C-fiber tactile (CT) afferents sensitive to slowly moving stimuli. They project to the posterior insular cortex and signal pleasant aspects of touch. Importantly, CTs have not been found in the glabrous skin of the hand, yet it is commonly observed that glabrous skin touch is also perceived as pleasant. Here we asked if the brain processing of pleasant touch differs between hairy and glabrous skin by stroking the forearm and glabrous skin of the hand during positron emission tomography. The data showed that, when contrasting slow brush stroking on the forearm with slow brush stroking on the palm, there were significant activations of the posterior insular cortex and mid-anterior orbitofrontal cortex. The opposite contrast showed a significant activation of the somatosensory cortices. Although concurrent psychophysical ratings showed no differences in intensity or pleasantness ratings, a subsequent touch questionnaire in which subjects used a newly developed 'touch perception task' showed significant difference for the two body sites. Emotional descriptors received higher ratings on the forearm and sensory descriptors were rated more highly on the palm. The present findings are consistent with the hypothesis that pleasant touch from hairy skin, mediated by CT afferents, is processed in the limbic-related cortex and represents an innate non-learned process. In contrast, pleasant touch from glabrous skin, mediated by A-beta afferents, is processed in the somatosensory cortex and represents an analytical process dependent on previous tactile experiences. Previous fMRI studies in two rare patients, together with microneurography and psychophysical observations in healthy subjects, have demonstrated a system of mechanosensitive C-tactile afferents (CT) sensitive to slowly moving stimuli.

abstract = {Additive Manufacturing (AM) or 3D printing (3DP) process is a layer by layer manufacturing approach for manufacturing parts with complex geometries. The STL (Stereolithography) file format is the de-facto industry standard for manufacturing parts by AM/3DP. The STL file is a triangular mesh representation of CAD geometry in non-uniform rational B-spline (NURBS) surface format and thus is an approximation of actual part geometry. During the conversion of a complex CAD geometry to an STL file, geometric errors are introduced in the model. These drawbacks associated with the STL file may translate into a faulty or inaccurate final manufactured part. This paper presents a novel Image Processing (IP) based Direct CAD Slicer, IPSlicer, which can be used to manufacture components directly from CAD geometry (without converting to STL file). Using sectional image snapshots of a part, captured normal to the build direction and sectional 2D bounding box data, contour points for each section are identified by performing boundary tracing operation followed by application of Contour Mapping Algorithm (CMA). The method slices the actual NURBS geometry and thus parts manufactured by this method have reduced GD{\&}T errors such as flatness, cylindricity, and profile error. In addition, a support removability analysis tool is developed by performing color-based segmentation on sectional image snapshots in conjunction with a pixel traversal approach. Using the segmented images and sectional bounding box, a sintering area and time calculation tool for each layer is also developed. The effectiveness of IPSlicer is verified by virtually manufacturing test components and calculating GD{\&}T errors by the application of computational metrology algorithms on virtually manufactured data. The support removability analysis tool as well as sintering time and area calculator are validated using several test parts.},

abstract = {Ratio scaling was used to obtain from 5 subjects estimates of the subjective dissimilarity between the members of all possible pairs of 17 tactile surfaces. The stimuli were a diverse array of everyday surfaces, such as corduroy, sandpaper, and synthetic fur. The results were analyzed using the multidimensional scaling (MDS) program ALSCAL. There was substantial, but not complete, agreement across subjects in the spatial arrangement of perceived textures. Scree plots and multivariate analysis suggested that, for some subjects, a two-dimensional space was the optimal MDS solution, whereas for other subjects, a three-dimensional space was indicated. Subsequent to their dissimilarity scaling, subjects rated each stimulus on each of five adjective scales. Consistent with earlier research, two of these (rough/smooth and soft/hard) were robustly related to the space for all subjects. A third scale, sticky/slippery, was more variably related to the dissimilarity data: regressed into three-dimensional MDS space, it was angled steeply into the third dimension only for subjects whose scree plots favored a nonplanar solution. We conclude that the sticky/slippery dimension is perceptually weighted less than the rough/smooth and soft/hard dimensions, materially contributing to the structure of perceptual space only in some individuals.},

abstract = {The vehicles used for transportation and logistics in the factories usually perceive their surroundings with range sensors. Today, 2D LIDARs are used as range sensors, and 3D LIDARs are becoming widespread with the developments of autonomous vehicle technology. Therefore, Self Adaptive Monte Carlo Localization, abbreviated as SA-MCL, is improved in this study to make the algorithm suitable for autonomous guided vehicles (AGVs) equipped with 2D or 3D LIDARs. Moreover, the traditional SA-MCL algorithm has a constraint that the range sensors on the robot are uniformly placed, and ellipse based energy model is proposed in this study to remove the constraint. This model can compute the energy value regardless of the robot orientation since it considers offsets due to the asymmetric placement of range sensors on the robot. The importance of localization increases since it is aimed that AGVs to be used in smart factories are able to use entire free space on the map in order to provide energy efficiency and time saving, and perform tasks that can vary at anytime instead of routine.

abstract = {The relationships between computational texture features and human touch feeling were investigated. Twenty four tactile plaques were manufactured. The textures for the plaques were copies of visual textures in which the grey scale was converted to height, or were copies of existing tactile textures. Textural features of the plaques' topographies were extracted using the most common statistical analysis techniques used in machine vision. Human touch affect was measured by asking 107 participants to touch and rate the plaques against a set of adjectives in a psychological experiment. Partial least squares regression and wrapper methodology were used to predict a set of dependent variables (20 human touch feeling features) and to select a significant subset of variables from a large set of independent variables (115 computational features). The results identify a subset of features that appear to have the most important effect on human touch feeling. These results will be used to synthesize plaques with the required human touch feeling features. {\textcopyright}2009 IEEE.},

abstract = {Prior research has assumed that touch has a persuasive effect only if it provides attribute or structural information about a product. Under this view, the role of touch as a persuasive tool is limited. The main purpose of this research is to investigate the persuasive influence of touch as an affective tool in the absence of useful product-related information. The authors find that for people who are motivated to touch because it is fun or interesting, a communication that incorporates touch leads to increased affective response and increased persuasion, particularly when the touch provides neutral or positive sensory feedback. People who are not motivated to touch for fun will also be persuaded by a communication that incorporates touch when they are able to make sense of how the touch is related to the message. The authors explore the effectiveness of different types of touch in generating an affective response, and they replicate the effects on attitudes and behavior in a real-world setting. This research suggests that the marketing implications of touch are more substantial than previously believed.},

abstract = {Despite the crucial role of touch in social development, there is very little functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) research on brain mechanisms underlying social touch processing. The "skin as a social organ" hypothesis is supported by the discovery of C-tactile (CT) nerves that are present in hairy skin and project to the insular cortex. CT-fibers respond specifically well to slow, gentle touch such as that which occurs during close social interactions. Given the social significance of such touch researchers have proposed that the CT-system represents an evolutionarily conserved mechanism important for normative social development. However, it is currently unknown whether brain regions other than the insula are involved in processing CT-targeted touch. In the current fMRI study, we sought to characterize the brain regions involved in the perception of CT-supported affective touch. Twenty-two healthy adults received manual brush strokes to either the arm or palm. A direct contrast of the blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) response to gentle brushing of the arm and palm revealed the involvement of a network of brain regions, in addition to the posterior insula, during CT-targeted affective touch to the arm. This network included areas known to be involved in social perception and social cognition, including the right posterior superior temporal sulcus and the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC)/dorso anterior cingulate cortex (dACC). Connectivity analyses with an mPFC/dACC seed revealed coactivation with the left insula and amygdala during arm touch. These findings characterize a network of brain regions beyond the insula involved in coding CT-targeted affective touch. Hum Brain Mapp, 2013. {\textcopyright} 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

abstract = {In a highly competitive market, customers' product affection is a critical factor to product success. However, understanding customers' affective needs is difficult to grasp; product design practitioners often misunderstand what customers really want. In this study we report our experience in developing and using an affective design framework that identified critical affective features customers have on products and are systematically incorporated into product design attributes. To identify key affec-tive features such as luxuriousness, we utilized the Kansei engineering methodology. This approach consists of three steps: (1) selecting related affective features and product design attributes through a comprehensive literature survey, expert panel opinion, and focus group interviews; (2) conducting evaluation experiments; and (3) developing Kansei models using multivariate statistical analysis and analyzing critical product design attributes. To demonstrate applicability of the proposed affective design framework, 30 customers and 30 product design practitioners participated in an evaluation experiment for car crash pads, and 44 customers and 20 designers participated in an evaluation experiment for two interior room products (wallpapers and flooring materials). The evaluation experiments were conducted via systematically developed questionnaires consisting of a 7-point semantic differential scale and a 100-point magnitude estimation scale. The results of the experiments were analyzed using principal component regression and quantification theory type I method. Using the analyzed survey data, the relationship between luxuriousness and related affective features and product design attributes were identified. This relationship indicated that there was a significant difference in the perception of luxuriousness between customers and designers. Consequently, it is expected that the results of this study could provide a foundation for developing affective products. C 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract = {The hedonic attributes of tactile stimulation are important to one's quality of life, yet they have rarely been studied scientifically. The earliest experimental investigations suggested soft and smooth materials as pleasant, those that were stiff, rough, or coarse as unpleasant. More recent studies conducted by the authors and described herein obtained ratings of pleasantness of different textured materials stroked across the skin of multiple body sites at controlled velocities and forces of application. Statistically significant interactions between materials, sites, velocities, forces and subject sex attest to the complexity of the percept. Less pleasant percepts arose from stimuli that were rougher. However, the difficulty in making further general statements regarding hedonic touch raises questions as to whether the body surface can be mapped affectively in a meaningful manner with a single stimulus and indeed whether pleasantness-to-touch can be viewed as a unidimensional construct. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The aim was to explore the touch perceptions of textures and identify their relationships with the surfaces' physical properties. Thirty-seven tactile textures were tested including 22 cardboards, nine flexible materials and six laminate boards. Semantic differential questionnaires were administered to assess responses to touching the textures against six word pairs: warm-cold, slippery-sticky, smooth,-rough, hard-soft, bumpy-flat, and wet-dry. Four physical measurements were conducted to characterize the surfaces' roughness, compliance, friction, and the rate of cooling of an artificial finger when touching the surface. Correlation and regression analyses were carried out to identify the relationships between the people's responses and the physical measurements. Results show that touch perception is often associated with more than one physical property, and the strength and form of the combined contribution can be represented by a regression model. {\textcopyright} 2009 Chen, Shao, Barnes, Childs, {\&} Henson.},

abstract = {Multidimensional scaling (MDS) methods include principal components analysis (PCA), principal co-ordinates analysis (PCO), canonical variates analysis (CVA) and non-metric MDS. All these can be used for comparing levels within and between pollen diagrams, for ordination of modern pollen spectra, or for comparing modern with fossil pollen spectra. All exist in numerous variants, depending on a choice of dissimilarity coefficient (DC) (except CVA, which is a specialized technique for use when prior groupings are available). It is shown that the many methods and variants that have been applied to pollen data can nevertheless be understood within a single conceptual frame. Guidelines for choice are established. PCA is shown to have several practical advantages over competitors, but it is suggested that MDS may sometimes be more informative with wide-ranging data sets. PCO allows a wider choice of DCs than PCA but is less convenient in other ways. DCs are categorized according to their meaning in a specifically palynological context. The most useful may be either the simplest (e.g. Manhattan metric, Euclidean distance), or some more complex measures designed to maximize "signal" contribution as against statistical "noise": CVA implies one such measure (Mahalanobis' D2). Standardization in PCA is shown to have drawbacks, and there are plausible alternatives. Correlation coefficients are found unsuitable for comparing pollen spectra. Emphasis throughout is on concepts and assumptions in MDS. The sections covering DCs are also relevant to other applications, including cluster analysis and numerical zonation. {\textcopyright} 1980.},

abstract = {The discovery that pleasant touch is coded by C-tactile fibers has generated considerable research interest and increased understanding of the skin as a channel for social information via cutaneous senses. However, no study has differentiated between the pleasant response to visual and tactile non-human stimulations. Our study investigated pleasant touch in which the visual and haptic touch information was obtained from an affective, but non-social experience, by a custom-built non-human device. Participants (n = 19) received soft brush strokes on their lower left arm delivered by a rotary tactile stimulator (physical session) or watched a video of an arm being stroked by a rotary tactile stimulator (visual session). The brush strokes were delivered at the same velocities (0.3, 1, 3, 10, 30 cm/s) and force (0.4 N) in both sessions. After each trial, participants rated the pleasantness of the touch. Analysis of variance was used to assess the effects of velocity and modality (visual touch vs. physical touch) on the pleasantness rating. Participants rated strokes between 1 and 10 cm/s as most pleasant under both conditions. The pleasantness rating patterns differed significantly among velocities; however, no significant differences were found between modalities. Visual and physical (without human-to-human interaction) touch elicited similar behavioral responses, including an inverted U-shaped perception of pleasantness. These findings suggest that the pleasantness of touch is influenced by the velocity of the strokes in both visual and physical touch with a non-human stimulation.},

The robot moves under the guidance of an external Kinect sensor, and squeezes the clothes with a GelSight tactile sensor, then it recognizes the 11 properties of the clothing according to the tactile data. Those properties include the physical properties, like thickness, fuzziness, softness and durability, and semantic properties, like wearing season and preferred washing methods. We collect a dataset of 153 varied pieces of clothes, and conduct 6616 robot exploring iterations on them. To extract the useful information from the high-dimensional sensory output, we applied Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) on the tactile data for recognizing the clothing properties, and on the Kinect depth images for selecting exploration locations. Experiments show that using the trained neural networks, the robot can autonomously explore the unknown clothes and learn their properties. This work proposes a new framework for active tactile perception system with vision-touch system, and has potential to enable robots to help humans with varied clothing related housework.},

It reports measurements of how the roughness affects a person's feelings caused by the sliding when the person believes the glass to be intended to be used for cosmetics' packaging. The main purpose has been to gain experience in design of surface touch experiments, self-report data collection and multi-variate statistical analysis of that data, to link subjective outcomes with their physical cause. The paper contains details of these activities. Tests have been carried out with glass surfaces both acid etched and grit blasted, to attain a range of surface roughnesses (Ra) from approximately 1-10 $\mu$m. The main conclusion about the feelings caused by sliding is that while a surface is less rough than a finger tip, it generates desirable feelings but when it is rougher than a finger tip it generates undesirable ones (all in the context of what is deemed to be desirable for cosmetics' packaging). {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

@article{Connor1990,
abstract = {Hypothetical neural codes underlying the sensation of tactile roughness were investigated in a combined psychophysical and neurophysiological study. The stimulus set consisted of plastic surfaces embossed with dot arrays of varying dot diameter and center-to-center spacing. Human subjects explored each surface with the pad of the index finger and reported their subjective sense of roughness magnitude. The same surfaces were scanned across the receptive fields of cutaneous mechanoreceptive afferents in monkeys while recording the evoked action potentials. Hypothetical neural codes for roughness magnitude were computed from the neural response patterns and tested for their ability to account for the psychophysical data. The psychophysical results showed that subjective roughness magnitude is an inverted U-shaped function of dot spacing that peaks near 3.0 mm spacing, and that increased dot diameter produces decreased roughness sensations at all dot spacings. Hypothetical neural codes that do not bear a consistent relationship to roughness magnitude across all of these stimulus conditions can be rejected as the code for roughness. Four types of neural codes were considered. They were based on (1) mean firing rate, (2) general variation in firing rate, (3) short-term temporal variation in firing rate, and (4) local spatial variation in firing rate. Mean firing rate failed to explain the psychophysical results: surfaces that evoked the same firing rate often evoked very different roughness judgments. In contrast, neural codes based on firing-rate variation, especially in slowly adapting afferents, account for the psychophysical results.},

Minimizing the make span, the MILP generates the optimal schedule for the autonomous guided vehicles (AGVs) in a blocking reentrant job shop environment with different jobs. Feasible schedules for the machines and the AGVs are generated from different sized instances to evaluate the limits of the mathematical model. These results are compared to a priority rule based dispatching system, evaluated with a discrete event simulation. The comparison leads to the insight, that on the one hand optimal solutions cannot be calculated for most real world scenarios due to the complexity and on the other hand the application of a standard dispatching rule lead to poor performances neither of the technics are satisfying the need to generate an appropriate schedule. As a result possible solutions are presented.},

abstract = {The past few decades have seen a rapid rise in the popularity of studies addressing the cognitive and neural correlates of aesthetic judgments in humans. However, despite this growing trend, and despite the fact that artists have, over the centuries, exploited each and every one of the human senses for their communicative purposes, very little research has investigated this important topic from the point of view of the sense of touch. In this review, we highlight for the first time a number of the key characteristics that an aesthetics of touch ought to have. In particular, starting from the artists' and the visual aesthetics points of view, we summarize those empirical findings relevant to the tactile modality. We suggest that while tactile aesthetics has many similarities with visual aesthetics there are also a number of important differences. In particular, the hedonic experience of touch appears to be more intimate, active (requiring the involvement of body movement), and "primitive" than that generated by visual stimuli. Finally, we show that a widespread network of brain areas appears to be involved in the various different aspects of tactile aesthetic experience. {\textcopyright} 2011 Taylor {\&} Francis.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to examine the subjective dimensionality of tactile surface texture perception. Seventeen tactile stimuli, such as wood, sandpaper, and velvet, were moved across the index finger of the subject, who sorted them into categories on the basis of perceived similarity. Multidimensional scaling (MDS) techniques were then used to position the stimuli in a perceptual space on the basis of combined data of 20 subjects. A three-dimensional space was judged to give a satisfactory representation of the data. Subjects' ratings of each stimulus on five scales representing putative dimensions of perceived surface texture were then fitted by regression analysis into the MDS space. Roughness-smoothness and hardness-softness were found to be robust and orthogonal dimensions; the third dimension did not correspond closely with any of the rating scales used, but post hoc inspection of the data suggested that it may reflect the compressional elasticity ("springiness") of the surface. {\textcopyright} 1993 Psychonomic Society, Inc.},

abstract = {A process for the design and manufacture of 3D tactile textures with predefined affective properties was developed. Twenty four tactile textures were manufactured. Texture measures from the domain of machine vision were used to characterize the digital representations of the tactile textures. To obtain affective ratings, the textures were touched, unseen, by 107 participants who scored them against natural, warm, elegant, rough, simple, and like, on a semantic differential scale. The texture measures were correlated with the participants' affective ratings using a novel feature subset evaluation method and a partial least squares genetic algorithm. Six measures were identified that are significantly correlated with human responses and are unlikely to have occurred by chance. Regression equations were used to select 48 new tactile textures that had been synthesized using mixing algorithms and which were likely to score highly against the six adjectives when touched by participants. The new textures were manufactured and rated by participants. It was found that the regression equations gave excellent predictive ability. The principal contribution of the work is the demonstration of a process, using machine vision methods and rapid prototyping, which can be used to make new tactile textures with predefined affective properties. {\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE.},

In this context, capacity optimization goes beyond the traditional aim of capacity maximization, contributing also for organization's profitability and value. Indeed, lean management and continuous improvement approaches suggest capacity optimization instead of maximization. The study of capacity optimization and costing models is an important research topic that deserves contributions from both the practical and theoretical perspectives. This paper presents and discusses a mathematical model for capacity management based on different costing models (ABC and TDABC). A generic model has been developed and it was used to analyze idle capacity and to design strategies towards the maximization of organization's value. The trade-off capacity maximization vs operational efficiency is highlighted and it is shown that capacity optimization might hide operational inefficiency.},

Increase in finger force also slightly increased the slope of the magnitude estimation function, suggesting not only that the roughness of a uniform surface but also the contrasts in the roughness of differing parts of a patterned surface would be altered by changes in the manner of feeling the surface. An analogous effect has been reported in vision, in that increases in illumination increase the apparent contrast of a surface. {\textcopyright} 1972 Psychonomic Society, Inc.},

@article{McGlone2007,
abstract = {Somatic sensation comprises four main modalities, each relaying tactile, thermal, painful, or pruritic (itch) information to the central nervous system. These input channels can be further classified as subserving a sensory function of spatial and temporal localization, discrimination, and provision of essential information for controlling and guiding exploratory tactile behaviours, and an affective function that is widely recognized as providing the afferent neural input driving the subjective experience of pain, but not so widely recognized as also providing the subjective experience of affiliative or emotional somatic pleasure of touch. The discriminative properties of tactile sensation are mediated by a class of fast-conducting myelinated peripheral nerve fibres - A-beta fibres - whereas the rewarding, emotional properties of touch are hypothesized to be mediated by a class of unmyelinated peripheral nerve fibres - CT afferents (C tactile) - that have biophysical, electrophysiological, neurobiological, and anatomical properties that drive the temporally delayed emotional somatic system. CT afferents have not been found in the glabrous skin of the hand in spite of numerous electrophysiological explorations of this area. Hence, it seems reasonable to conclude that they are lacking in the glabrous skin. A full understanding of the behavioural and affective consequences of the differential innervation of CT afferents awaits a fuller understanding of their function.

In Experiment 2, 20 volunteers used a free-sorting task to sort 24 car seat ' materials, with different tactile properties, on the basis of perceived similarity. Sorted groups were then characterized further by producing verbal labels. Multidimensional scaling and correspondence analysis indicated that the tactile texture space did not exceed four dimensions. The hypothesized perceptual dimensions were soft/harsh, thin/thick, relief and hardness. Further evidence for the relevance of these dimensions was provided in Experiment 3, in which participants were asked to evaluate the stimuli according to unipolar adjective scales corresponding to the previously derived dimensions. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier B.V.

Recent research with U.S. adults found that the resistance to include nutritious foods at breakfast is due in part to misconceptions about what “breakfast” should be. Here, we assessed the development of these misconceptions in 4- and 5-year-old children. Similar to American adults, U.S. children perceive typical breakfast foods as especially appropriate for breakfast and believe that alternatives typically consumed at lunch or dinner are less suitable for breakfast. This leads them to be unwilling to add nutritious alternatives to their breakfast repertoire. Unlike U.S. children, Chinese children are not as likely to hold these mistaken beliefs and are more motivated to try healthy alternatives at breakfast. Our findings cast light on the developmental roots of Americans' tendency to consume unhealthy breakfasts and have implications for interventions to boost healthy eating behaviors from early on.},

We investigate the role of local and global processing further using the RFST in four experiments. High AQ adults maintained a consistent advantage in search speed across diverse target-distracter stimulus conditions. This advantage may reflect enhanced local processing of curvature in early stages of the form vision pathway and superior global detection of shape primitives. However, more probable is the presence of a superior search process that enables a consistent search advantage at both levels of processing.},

We use fabrics as an example of a deformable material with a rich set of mechanical properties. A thin flexible fabric, when draped, tends to look different from a heavy stiff fabric. It also feels different when touched. Using a collection of 118 fabric samples, we captured color and depth images of draped fabrics along with tactile data from a high-resolution touch sensor. We then sought to associate the information from vision and touch by jointly training CNNs across the three modalities. Through the CNN, each input, regardless of the modality, generates an embedding vector that records the fabric's physical property. By comparing the embedding vectors, our system is able to look at a fabric image and predict how it will feel, and vice versa. We also show that a system jointly trained on vision and touch data can outperform a similar system trained only on visual data when tested purely with visual inputs.},

abstract = {I am not a failure {\ldots} but I feel like one and expect to fail every day of my working life within the neoliberal academy. This somewhat autoethnographic essay reflects upon six distinct, though related, feelings of failure which are everyday, axiomatic, but often-unspoken experiences of contemporary academic life. It considers failure in terms of: (i) things not going to plan; (ii) pervasive anxieties about performance within the neoliberal academy; (iii) regret, or wanting to do more; (iv) embodied senses of personal inadequacy and (not)belonging; (v) assessment criteria and procedures; and (vi) a vast, lucrative infrastructure of consultants, training organisations, entrepreneurial/leadership discourses and performative strategies which claim (triumph-over-)adversity as a kind of currency or capital to be deployed, monetised and enclosed. In so doing, this intervention opens a space to both acknowledge personal, embodied senses of failure and critically reflect on the Special Issue's aims of reclaiming failure within the contemporary neoliberal academy. The intervention ends with a series of questions which might serve as prompts for thinking-with failure and fostering more collegiate, critical ideas of success in the neoliberal academy.},

@article{Okamoto2013,
abstract = {This paper reviews studies on the tactile dimensionality of physical properties of materials in order to determine a common structure for these dimensions. Based on the commonality found in a number of studies and known mechanisms for the perception of physical properties of textures, we conclude that tactile textures are composed of three prominent psychophysical dimensions that are perceived as roughness/smoothness, hardness/softness, and coldness/warmness. The roughness dimension may be divided into two dimensions: macro and fine roughness. Furthermore, it is reasonable to consider that a friction dimension that is related to the perception of moistness/dryness and stickiness/slipperiness exists. Thus, the five potential dimensions of tactile perception are macro and fine roughness, warmness/coldness, hardness/softness, and friction (moistness/dryness, stickiness/slipperiness). We also summarize methods such as psychological experiments and mathematical approaches for structuring tactile dimensions and their limitations. {\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE.},

@book{Olausson2016,
abstract = {CT afferents are receptors in mammalian hairy skin that fire action potentials when the skin is touched lightly which makes them particularly important in affective touch. Traditionally neuroscientific research has focused on more discriminative and haptic properties of touch that are mediated by large myelinated afferents and the coding properties and functional organization of unmyelinated CT afferents have been studied much less. The proposed volume will draw together existing knowledge in this nascent field. Separate sections will address (1) how we can measure affective touch, (2) CT structure and physiology, (3) CT processing, (4) the contribution of CTs to sexual behavior, (5) clinical relevance, (6) commercial relevance, and (7) future research considerations.},

@article{Klatzky1999,
abstract = {Subjects made roughness judgments of textured surfaces made of raised elements, while holding stick-like probes or through a rigid sheath mounted on the fingertip. These rigid links, which impose vibratory coding of roughness, were compared with the finger (bare or covered with a compliant glove), using magnitude-estimation and roughness differentiation tasks. All end effectors led to an increasing function relating subjective roughness magnitude to surface interelement spacing, and all produced above-chance roughness discrimination. Although discrimination was best with the finger, rigid links produced greater perceived roughness for the smoothest stimuli. A peak in the magnitude-estimation functions for the small probe and a transition from calling more sparsely spaced surfaces rougher to calling them smoother were predictable from the size of the contact area. The results indicate the potential viability of vibratory coding of roughness through a rigid link and have implications for teleoperation and virtual-reality systems.},

@article{Taylor1975,
abstract = {Previous experimental data on the roughness of grooved aluminum tiles provide a data base against which to test theories of roughness perception. A model based on the static deformation of the skin touching the stimulus tile is developed, and 11 parameters of the deformation are individually compared with the experimental data. All parameters were tested first in an approximate way, and then the better parameters were recalculated in a more exact manner. Three parameters, the depth to which the finger penetrates the groove, the cross-sectional area of the finger within the groove, and the cross-sectional area of the deviation of the skin from its resting position, all predict the roughness well as a function of finger force and groove width. The last of the three predicts roughness best as a function of land width, and is tentatively preferred as "the stimulus for roughness." All predictions from the static model indicate that variation of the coefficient of friction between skin and tile should have little or no effect. This counterintuitive prediction was confirmed by an experiment. {\textcopyright} 1975 Psychonomic Society, Inc.},
